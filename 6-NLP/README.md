# Getting started with natural language processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written -- referred to as natural language. It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI). NLP has existed for more than 50 years and has roots in the field of linguistics. The whole field is directed at helping machines understand and process the human language. This can then be used to perform tasks like spell check or machine translation. It has a variety of real-world applications in a number of fields, including medical research, search engines and business intelligence.
